[] (2018-09-24) : Composer's 'wrap-class'
	Is anyone using this 'wrap-class'? Should it be a class `const` instead of a
	`define`?

[] (2018-07-05) : Common user, cookie objects
	Started a common implementation of `dsAccount` and `dsCookie`, but removed it
	in lieu of `LoginHelper`. However, a common `dsCookie` (and maybe also
	`dsUser`) might be handy, if can figure out a way to integrate it cleanly in
	all the different users of wCommon.

[] (2018-03-03) : Bespoke template
	Create a template, based on HTMLComposer, and remove dependency on
	`HTML_Template_Sigma`, which isn't going anywhere soon, but has been out of
	active development for a few years now. Template needs are so simple that a
	not-too-complicated class could produce it on demand.

[] (2017-09-30) : Clean up comments
	Review comments and make them complete sentences with initial capital and
	trailing period. Limit use of "the" and "a[n]".

[] (2016-10-02) : HTML5
	Update the template to use HTML5

[✓] (2019-05-16) : Time and date display
	Function to display midnight and noon is wrong because it is not using 24
	hour clock 'H'. Copy correct formula from BYT and role out to clients.

[✓] (2018-07-10) : Mail dependency
	Add pear/mail to our composer requires. Also added pear/net_smtp and
	pear/auth_sasl as recommended by pear/mail.

[✓] (2018-07-09) : Composer integration
	Add a `composer.json` file and reorganize as necessary to work with Composer
	and Packagist.
