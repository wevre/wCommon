project : wCommon ToDo
	author : Mike Weaver

[] (2018-07-09) : Composer integration
	Add a `composer.json` file and reorganize as necessary to work with Composer
	and Packagist.

[] (2018-07-05) : Common user, cookie objects
	Started a common implementation of `dsAccount` and `dsCookie`, but removed it
	in lieu of `LoginHelper`. However, a common `dsCookie` (and maybe also
	`dsUser`) might be handy, if can figure out a way to integrate it cleanly in
	all the different users of wCommon.

[] (2018-03-03) : Bespoke template
	Create a template, based on HTMLComposer, and remove dependency on
	`HTML_Template_Sigma`, which isn't going anywhere soon, but has been out of
	active development for a few years now. Template needs are so simple that a
	not-too-complicated class could produce it on demand.

[] (2017-09-30) : Clean up comments
	Review comments and make them complete sentences with initial capital and
	trailing period. Limit use of "the" and "a[n]".

[] (2016-10-02) : HTML5
	Update the template to use HTML5
