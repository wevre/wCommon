[] (2019-07-02) : Static calls
	Should `call_user_func` be replaced with `forward_static_call`?

[] (2019-06-07) : Calls to standard functions
	What happens when we call functions like `prefixIfCe` or `array_key_map` or
	`getHost` in a client like DAC or BYT. If those have been overridden in their
	namespace, which version is used?

[] (2017-09-30) : Clean up comments
	Review comments and make them complete sentences with initial capital and
	trailing period. Limit use of "the" and "a[n]".
		[X] HTMLComposer
		[] FormBuilder
		[X] Standard

[X] (2019-06-08) : Git follow tags
	For this and dStruct, that are delivered as packages via Composer, I need to
	maintain tags and upload them to the remote. That can be automated by setting
	this global config:

	```
		git config --global push.followTags true

	Then when I commit changes, add a tag and push.

	```
		git commit -m 'Some changes'
		git tag v2.3.4 -m 'v2.3.4' # -m makes it an annotated tag
		git push

[X] (2019-06-07) : LH host
	LoginHelper needs to be initialized with a `host`.

[X] (2019-06-07) : Set block variables
	Changed the order around in `setBlockVariables` so we don't have to always
	pass `null` as the first parameter. Also added `$title` as a first parameter
	to Template's constructor.

[X] (2019-06-07) : Server helper
	Move the `g_SITECODE` type define into a class as const's and include
	server-related functions such as confirmServer, isStageRegion, getHost,
	basically anything that is using those constants.

[X] (2019-06-07) : URL composer
	Create a class URLComposer that we can initialize with path, query, keys,
	scheme, etc. and then get a URL out the other end. It will probably always be
	a one-and-done, but it will make our logic clearer what is going on. We can
	add query parameters from existing REQUEST or from an array or one at a time
	with different function calls.

[X] (2019-06-07) : dcode scanner
	Make dCode into a class.

[X] (2019-06-07) : Page title
	Get this out of $GLOBAL and just let it live on the template class as a
	member.

[X] (2019-06-06) : BYT specific
	Functions `composeActionLinks` and `composePropertyList` are only used by
	BYT. Seem pretty specific to be here. Similarly, `warn` and `areYouSure`
	could easily be specialized by subclasses in BYT and DAC.

[X] (2018-09-24) : Composer's 'wrap-class'
	Is anyone using this 'wrap-class'? Should it be a class `const` instead of a
	`define`? Yes, and yes. And it should probably move to BYT's subclass.

[X] (2019-06-07) : Login success
	Function `onSuccessfulLogin` needs to move from BYT and DAC into the
	LoginHelper. This will allow some methods to become protected. Same thing
	with logout.

[X] (2019-06-06) : Login helper
	The LoginHelper class is wonderful. Let's fix up comments.
	Same with Template.

[X] (2019-06-06) : Template block names
	Get rid of plurals in template block names: BLK-ONLOAD, BLK-MAIN-ITEM. Can
	maybe make them class constants so they can be overridden, if necessary, by
	subclasses.

[X] (2019-06-06) : URL in error log
	Always add getURLPath to the ident in function `errorLog` and then remove
	that logic from BYT and DAC19.

[X] (2016-10-02) : HTML5
	Update the template to use HTML5

[✓] (2019-05-16) : Time and date display
	Function to display midnight and noon is wrong because it is not using 24
	hour clock 'H'. Copy correct formula from BYT and role out to clients.

[✓] (2018-07-10) : Mail dependency
	Add pear/mail to our composer requires. Also added pear/net_smtp and
	pear/auth_sasl as recommended by pear/mail.

[✓] (2018-07-09) : Composer integration
	Add a `composer.json` file and reorganize as necessary to work with Composer
	and Packagist.
